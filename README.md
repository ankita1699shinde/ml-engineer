This project implements a deep learning pipeline to classify flower images by flower type, dominant color, and to estimate concentrations of three essential oils (simulated values) from flower images.
This code pipeline builds and trains a multi-task deep learning model to classify flower images by:

Type of Flower

Dominant Color

Estimate concentrations of 3 essential oils (simulated values)
